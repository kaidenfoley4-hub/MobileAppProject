Firstly this would be a calendar and day planner app

Currently the ideas for features include
Import & Export to outlook & Google Calendar
Reminder
Setting up calendar with clickable events
Reminders with notifications
Tag search through the events for a particular day
Widget for home screen
Import timetable
Dark mode / Light mode switch

We will check if these count as features then add them to the Trello
